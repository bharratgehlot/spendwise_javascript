  <h1>Today's Read</h1>

    She heard the doctor saying
    "The treatment would require a lot of money."
    Little did she know about numbers.
    She bargained her favorite crayons for some rupees, her eraser for a some more, her favorite toy for a lot more. Her
    customers were baffled seeing the little girl asking them to buy. They contributed the most they could.
    With both palms barely being able to hold the money, she went to her mother.
    "See mumma so much money. Is it enough."
    She smiled at the innocence of her beautiful child. Cupped both her hands in her palms and kissed her cheeks.
    "It is more than enough, my child."
