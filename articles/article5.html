    We basically spend money on what we need & what we want.

    A need is something necessary to live and function.
    
    A want is something that can improve your quality of life.
    
    Using these criteria, a need includes food, clothing, shelter and medical care, while wants include everything else. In the current context having a reasonably good quality smart phone is a need & wanting to have an iphone or a high end phone is a want.
    
    The needs & wants differ from person to person & from time to time. So if someone wants to save money it is very essential for him or her to ask themselves, before buying anything - is this my need or a want? Once you start answering this question, automatically you will reduce spending money & thereby start saving more money.
    
    Now why do we save money - the basic need to save money is - life is uncertain & full of surprises or unforeseen events happening. The need to save money arises so that one has sufficient back-up created.
    
    Second common reason for saving money is - to fulfill one's goals which may require a substantial amount of money like purchase of house, buying a car, children's higher education, foreign vacation, house renovation etc.
    
    Third important reason is - one will have to retire one day due to age &/or due to medical condition. After retirement one needs money to provide for living expenses. For this saved money will be of great value & use.
